# Golb - CLI API Testing Tool

A lightweight command-line API testing tool, providing a terminal-based alternative to Postman. ( I know curl is nice, but I want to learn more about Golang. I also have some features in mind to add once the app supports all the HTTP methods. )

## Features

- Send HTTP requests directly from your terminal
- Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  --WIP
- Save and manage request collections
- Environment variable support
- JSON request/response formatting
- Request history
- Response headers and status code display
- Cookie handling
